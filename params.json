Its culture, riches, and splendor were unmatched throughout the lands. However, civil strife and disaster threaten to undermine its stability. All while the world begins to enter a new age.\r\n\r\n### Build a fleet to rule the seas in turn-based ship combat.\r\nWill you pilot a fast, maneuverable sloop, outrunning the Imperial gunships? Or will you hide behind a multi-deck fortress, outgunning all those who enter your range?\r\n\r\n### Take a side among those who wish to profit at the empire's expense.\r\nEmpires don't rise and fall in a vacuum. Will you aid a foreign power in their attempts to claim the Empire's territory, or will fight to retain tarnished Imperial glory? Or will you search for and find another path?\r\n\r\n### Keep up with development!\r\nFollow the game's progress on [our blog!](https://sunsetofaton.wordpress.com)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
