Its culture, riches, and splendor were unmatched throughout the lands. However, civil strife and disaster threaten to undermine its stability. All while the world begins to enter a new age.\r\n\r\n### Build a fleet to rule the seas in turn-based ship combat.\r\n![](https://raw.github.com/mcoirad/shadowsofaton/master/Assets/NotUsed/gamepreview.png)\r\nWill you pilot a fast, maneuverable sloop, outrunning the Imperial gunships?
